# Introduction

## Context

## Objectives

Characterize the Urban Planning Areas and estimate the incidence rates of scorpion accidents of Americana/SP in 1998-2018.

## Hypotheses

# Data



## Raw data

Dataset with number of accidents and population for each UPA and year between 1998 -- 2018.

## Analytical dataset

In order to enhance the numerical performance of the statistical models the year was recentered with a time index starting at 1, and covering all years in the study period.

All variables in the analytical set were labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.

After the cleaning process 5 variables were included in the analysis with 210 observations.
Table 1 shows the structure of the analytical dataset.


| upa | year | accidents | pop | time |
|:---:|:----:|:---------:|:---:|:----:|
|  1  |      |           |     |      |

| 210 |      |           |     |      |

The analytical dataset will be included in the private version of the report, and will be omitted from the public version of the report.

# Study variables

## Primary and secondary outcomes

Primary outcome will be defined as the incidence rate of scorpion accidents in each APU.
For each APU the incidence rates will be computed as the ratio between the number of incident accidents over the population.
<!-- Incidence rates will be reported per 10000 persons. -->

## Covariates

Incidence rates will be adjusted by year and population.

# Statistical methods

## Statistical analyses

### Descriptive analyses

<!-- The epidemiological profile of each study group -->
<!-- groups -->
<!-- will be described at baseline. -->
<!-- Demographic and clinical variables will be described as -->
The characteristics of the UPAs will be described at the year 2018, which will be hypothesized to be representative of static characteristics.
All variables collected will be described as 
mean (SD)
<!-- median (IQR) -->
or as counts and proportions (%), as appropriate.
Distributions will be summarized in tables and visualized in exploratory plots.

### Inferential analyses

<!-- All comparisons between groups will be performed as univariate analyses. -->
<!-- Continuous variables will be compared between groups with the -->
<!-- independent t test with Welch correction. -->
<!-- paired t test with Welch correction. -->
<!-- Wilcoxon test. -->
<!-- Differences in distribution of categorical variables will be assessed with the -->
<!-- Fisher exact test. -->
<!-- chi-square test. -->
<!-- McNemar test. -->
All inferences will be derived from the statistical model.

### Statistical modeling

A multiple Poisson regression will be specified to explore the relations between the accident incidence rates and the UPAs between 1998 and 2018 (ten UPAs, 21 years, 210 observations).
To account for increases in incident accidents an interaction term will be included for year and UPA, which will allow the incidence rates to increase independently.

## Significance and Confidence Intervals

All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
All significance hypothesis tests and confidence intervals computed will be
two-tailed.
<!-- left-tailed. -->
<!-- right-tailed. -->

## Study size and Power



N/A

## Statistical packages

This analysis will be performed using statistical software `R` version 4.1.1.
