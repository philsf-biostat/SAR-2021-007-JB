```

### Population

The population in all ten UPA have increased from
`r pull(change, pop)[1]` to
`r pull(change, pop)[2]` people during the 1998 -- 2008 period.
The three UPA that showed the largest population increase were
UPA 4, 6 and 10 with
`r pull(filter(increase, upa == 4), pop) %>% round`,
`r pull(filter(increase, upa == 6), pop) %>% round` and
`r pull(filter(increase, upa == 10), pop) %>% round` net growth, respectively (Figue 2).
On the other hand the three UPA with the lowest population growth in the period were
UPA 1, UPA 8 and UPA 9 with
`r pull(filter(increase, upa == 1), pop) %>% round`,
`r pull(filter(increase, upa == 8), pop) %>% round` and
`r pull(filter(increase, upa == 9), pop) %>% round` new persons, respectively.

While population grew in all UPA, in most cases the trajectory did not follow a monotonic trend.
In particular population at UPA 4 and 8 did not grow steadilly in order to reach the to the ranks of top 3 and bottom 3 in either absolute number and net growth.

UPA 4 and 8 started with similar population sizes, but at the end of the study period had dramatic final population differences.
Both did not start among the largest populations but UPA 4 had a sharp population increase while UPA 8 had a sharp decrease, at around the same period.
Having started with a similar population size, the final difference between the final population at these two particular UPA could be explained by this shift.

Furthermore, UPA 2 and 9 had a sharp decrease around the same period before resuming the slower, predictable growth rate of previous years.
UPA 2 had started with the second largest population of the ten UPA at 1998 and ended at the fourth largest population.

It is difficult to assess the impact of such rapid movements in population size in the accident rates.
If our assumption that the population is a proxy exposure for the risk of scorpion accidents, these rapid movements should be associated with the incidence risk.
Other possible explanations include a threshold population size, beyond which the risk is substantially increased.
We will assess this impact in the section 4.2.

# Observations and Limitations

**Scorpion population**

One limitation of this study is that we the scorpion population size in each UPA is not known, but gathering this data poses other challenges that are often reported in the Ecology modeling literature.
If scorpion population sizes were available across the study period, it could be used to control for the incidence rates measured in this ecological study.
Scorpion specimens are routinely captured by the public health surveillance system, and we hypothesize that this measure could be used as a proxy for the scorpion population.
We will consider updating the analysis with this metric in a future work, when more data becomes available.

**Population as a proxy for exposure**

It is difficult to assess the impact of such rapid movements in population size in the accident rates.
If our assumption that the population is a proxy exposure for the risk of scorpion accidents, these rapid movements should be associated with the incidence risk.
Other possible explanations include a threshold population size, beyond which the risk is substantially increased.

Another metric that could be used as a proxy to exposure would be population density.
We will consider updating the analysis with this metric in a future work, when more data becomes available.

**Ecological fallacy**

While some UPA clearly show incidence rates much higher than others, this should not be interpreted that these UPA pose a higher risk of scorpion accidents than other for individuals.
This is an ecological study and thus the data available are aggregate counts within each geographical region, so these results cannot be directly translated to a measure of individual risk of accident.

## Modeling procedures

The population of the UPA was considered as a proxy for the exposure to accidents.
This was incorporated in the model as the offset to compute the incidence rates and allowed to vary over time.
This means that the population is not considered as an explanatory variable in the regression model, but as a fixed coefficient in the incidence rates ratios.
Variation in population over the years are effectively only considered for the calculation of incidence rates.
